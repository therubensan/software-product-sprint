      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p class="aboutme">Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Ruben Sanchez. I am 20 years
          old and currently living in Anaheim, California. I have three siblings
          and two parents that I love. Lastly, I am a sophomore studying computer
          science with a concentration in systems at Stanford University.
          <br><br>
          I owe a lot of my success to my friends and family who have shown constant support
          in my struggles and triumphs. One aspect of my life that I thank them a lot for is 
          convincing me to pursue computer science as a major. I entered as a mathematics major 
          and had a lot of doubts about how it could translate to tangible success or interests
          in the future. I thought a lot about switching to an engineering major and ultimately
          decided on computer science. I'm glad I did. 
          <br><br>
          Aside from computer science, I find interest in eSports, cooking, and guacamole. Fun
          fact: I won Stanford's Annual Cooking Competition in my freshman year.
